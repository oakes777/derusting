# Items to Refresh on:

As you work through this exercise, write down anything that you needed to look up or struggled to remember here. It can be just a word or two (e.g. "joining strings"). You can use this as a guide of what to make extra sure you're refreshed on before exams and interviews.

- Taken from MapPractice.java class: 
// Iterate over the entries in the map, printing each key and value
    // Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry I had to ask for help from chatGPT on this part
    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : mappy.entrySet()) {
      System.out.println("Key: " + entry.getKey() + ", Value: " +
      entry.getValue());
    }
